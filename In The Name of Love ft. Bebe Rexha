[In The Name of Love ft. Bebe Rexha - Martin Garrix]


[00:07.52]If I told you this was only gonna hurt
[00:11.52]If I warned you that the fire's gonna burn
[00:15.33]Would you walk in? Would you let me do it first?
[00:19.37]Do it all in the name of love
[00:22.97]Would you let me lead you even when you're blind?
[00:26.79]In the darkness, in the middle of the night
[00:30.86]In the silence, when there's no one by your side
[00:34.75]Would you call in the name of love?
[00:38.10]In the name of love,
[00:41.80]In the name of love,
[00:45.72]In the name of love,
[00:49.44]In the name of love,
[00:57.17]In the name
[01:01.84]If I told you we could bathe in all the lights
[01:05.71]Would you rise up, come and meet me in the sky?
[01:09.52]Would you trust me when you're jumping from the heights?
[01:13.62]Would you fall in the name of love?
[01:17.20]When there's madness, when there's poison in your head
[01:21.14]When the sadness leaves you broken in your bed
[01:25.04]I will hold you in the depths of your despair
[01:29.10]And it's all in the name of love
[01:32.13]In the name of love,
[01:35.74]In the name of love,
[01:39.80]In the name of love,
[01:43.67]In the name of love,
[01:51.40]In the name
[01:56.48]I wanna testify
[02:00.17]Scream in the holy light
[02:04.05]You bring me back to life
[02:07.72]And it's all in the name of love
[02:12.04]I wanna testify
[02:15.79]Scream in the holy light
[02:19.67]You bring me back to life
[02:23.24]And it's all in the name of love
[02:26.57]In the name of love,
[02:30.44]In the name of love,
[02:33.98]In the name of love,
[02:38.00]In the name of love,
